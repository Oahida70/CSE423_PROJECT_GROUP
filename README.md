Features: 

Jump Mechanism: The car follows a realistic physics-based jump trajectory with gravity effects.
                Obstacle Avoidance: Avoid hitting trees by jumping over them.
                Collision detection determines if the game ends.


Power-Up Collection: Collect power-ups for score. Power-up score increases by 5 points. 


Dynamic Background and Display: Press d to switch to day mode and n to night mode.
                                Press p to pause the game and s to resume.

                                Game Over Message is displayed 
                                Birds with animated flapping wings fly across and Clouds move dynamically in the background, 
                                enhancing the game's atmosphere.

All of these are implemented using GL Points, Midpoint Line Algorithm, and Midpoint Circle Algorithm.
